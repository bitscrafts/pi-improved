# Pii — Pi Improved

**Pii** ("Pi Improved") is a single static Rust binary that unifies a terminal-native
AI coding agent, a personal assistant daemon, a reactive IoT/automation engine, and a
self-improving cognitive layer. It aims to replace Claude Code, Home Assistant, and a
messaging gateway with one performant, local-first, modular system.

## Reference Repos (read-only, in `_repos/`)

| Repo | Role in Pii |
|------|-------------|
| `pi_agent_rust/` | Coding-agent core: sub-100ms cold start, structured concurrency, capability-gated Cx, JSONL sessions |
| `zeroclaw/` | Assistant/gateway core: 30+ channels, ~20 LLM providers, tools, SOP engine, WASM plugin host, hardware HAL |
| `yantrikclaw/` | Cognitive memory (YantrikDB) + tier-aware tool selection for model sizes |
| `grok-build/` | TUI + Agent Client Protocol (ACP) + headless/CI modes |
| `hermes-agent/` | Cognitive self-improvement loop (skill extraction, procedural templates) |

## Docs Index

- [01-overview/](01-overview/) — high-level vision and architecture
  - `001-pii-vision.md` — the unified vision and architecture overview
- [02-guides/](02-guides/) — how-to guides
  - `pidag-way-of-work.md` — the SDD pipeline: static-graph orchestration, how pidag drives pi, the free→account→topup model ladder, the implement→quality-gate→validate loop, hard rules, and operational traps
  - `feature-gating.md` — how to make the monolith compilable-down: Cargo features gate surfaces (tui/web/evolve/channels/tls/memory/sandbox/github), never the engine substrate; trims vs service-izes
  - `pii-mcp-bridge.md` — the Hermes↔pii integration: pii-mcp crate (MCP server + client, feature-gated, rmcp quarantine); MCP = integration surface, UDS JSON-RPC = control plane
- [03-reference/](03-reference/) — technical reference
- [04-development/](04-development/) — developer docs / analysis
- [05-operations/](05-operations/) — operational / environment docs
- [06-research/](06-research/) — research write-ups (numbered)
  - `001-pii-architecture-plan.md` — Claude Code (opus) analysis of the 5 reference repos + full Pii architecture plan (pass 1)
  - `002-pii-architecture-plan-pass2.md` — pass 2: 12 new directions (observability, client-server, networking, layered memory, plugins, sync, callbacks, MCU, WASM first-class, critical review)
  - `003-pii-architecture-plan-pass3.md` — pass 3: nano-model Tier-0 as CPU assistant, harness/DAG/pipelines (orki diamond fix, fanout/convergence), reframes pass 2 §9
  - `004-granite-nano-tier-probe.md` — granite-4.2 tier-1 probe (llama.cpp `--reasoning off` required) + opus nano-tier recommendation + flexible model-coupling directive
  - `005-dsh-vs-pii-harness-analysis.md` — DeepSeek Harness (dsh) comparative analysis: convergent architecture validation, 5 upgrade paths, journal-hardening spec 11 extracted
  - `006-pii-graph-engine.md` — the graph-based automation engine: architecture, node kinds, route/if-then-else, loop_budget, capabilities/effects, event-sourced journal + resume, git-log-graph research & `pii graph show` implementation
  - `007-pii-phase4-plan.md` — opus MVP-complete review + Phase 4 "daily driver" plan: turn-loop hardening, session durability, memory v2, TLS, service packaging, web viewer, self-improvement
  - `008-pii-evolve.md` — P4.7 deep design: a self-aware "evolve" loop (new `pii-evolve` crate, per user override) that manages its own context (state.md + external memory + compaction), routes each step to a specific model tier, checks logs, patches in disposable worktrees, maintains a parallel dev/prod split with gated promotion, and keeps improving via web research
  - `009-pii-evolve-opus-review-pass1.md` — opus adversarial review (APPROVE WITH CHANGES): blocking resume+approval-gate bug, heal-watch phantom failure, anti-reward-hacking refusal; user override = dedicated `pii-evolve` crate
  - `010-pii-full-review-pass1.md` — FULL-codebase opus review (VERDICT: NEEDS WORK): P4.1c/4.1b broke the agent tool loop (chat_streaming drops tool_calls; call_tool_bounded substitutes empty CapSet; request_streaming doesn't dechunk) — every autonomous run reports success while doing nothing. Plus TLS lease leak, compaction-never-fires, O(n²) session writes, budget dimensions never charged.
